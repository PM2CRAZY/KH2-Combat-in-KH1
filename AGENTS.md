# AGENTS.md

Notes for anyone (human or AI agent) working on this repo.

## Ground rules

- Never commit game files, extracted tables, dumps, Ghidra databases or decompiled code. The
  `.gitignore` is a whitelist: add a pattern only for source, docs or manifests.
- Put scratch output (table dumps, binaries) in `local/`. It is ignored.
- `combat-core` must stay free of KH2 knowledge and engine dependencies. KH2-specific
  mapping belongs in `kh2-data`.
- Write down every rule's source and confidence in `docs/combat-model.md`.
- When code is ported from another project, credit it in `NOTICE` and `CREDITS.md`
  and keep its licence.

## Reverse-engineering notes

- Ghidra runs headless on a private copy of the user's executable, outside the repo. Commit
  only plain-language findings (in `docs/`) and our own Rust. Never commit decompiler output,
  Ghidra projects or byte dumps.

## Testing against the game

```

## Development log

### 2026-10-07: milestone 1
- Surveyed existing work: OpenKH (format docs and C# readers), GovanifY/kh2 (PS2 decomp, early
  stage), KHPCPatchManager. Chose documented formats; no decompiling was needed.
- Ported the HED/PKG reader. The cipher's substitution table is located in the user's exe at
  runtime by a sliding-window permutation search, then checked against a SHA-256.
- Parsed 00battle.bin. The counts on the user's install match OpenKH's docs (atkp 2713, enmp
  229, ...). Live and backup copies are identical.
- Derived from the data:
  - ATKP power is a percentage (most common value 100; Thunder spells use 375 = ×3.75)
  - the LVPM level-99 Defense of 51 matches the community example
  - ENMP min/max damage × HP is nearly constant, which suggests a fraction of HP
- Open: the clamp reading, critical_adjust scope, element ids 4–6. Next: an MSET/ANB motion
  trigger reader to get hitbox timing and Sora's combo attack ids.

### 2026-10-07: milestone 2 (movement + combat playground)
- Added readers for 03system.bin `pref` (prty/fmab/plyr/sstm), PTYA combo rows, MSET/ANB motion
  headers, root-motion F-curves, motion triggers and model collision.
- Findings on the user's install:
  - trigger frames are 60 Hz and relative to the clip start
  - Sora's keyblade hitbox windows live in `W_EX010.mset` at the same slots as `P_EX100.mset`
  - root motion: Dodge Roll 438 units, A300 lunge 92
  - fmab records 0–3 = growth LV1–MAX
- Built `character-core` (engine-agnostic controller) and `kh2-bevy` (capsule playground).
  The playground was verified under Xvfb with `--synthetic --autoplay --screenshot N`. The
  real-data path was verified on the user's machine with `kh2-combat sora`.
- Open: gravity (estimated), the combo `sub` chain, skeleton-accurate hitboxes, enemy attacks.

### 2026-10-08: Phase 1 from the executable
- Ghidra 12.1 headless on the user's exe. MSVC RTTI names the action classes, so the
  action vtables (jump, glide, air slide, hop, idle) were easy to find.
- Implemented from plain-language notes:
  - the 30 Hz velocity tick
  - the double-sine jump with gravity 20/49
  - air control 0.9/0.95
  - glide, Quick Run and Aerial Dodge formulas
  - the PTYA selector (table order, `sub` anti-repeat, kind/flag semantics, `combo_offset`)
  - the hit-driven combo counter
  - jump-attack arcs and the lunge factor
  - the damage routine (stat source byte, base-term clamps, ceil rounding, difficulty table,
    boosts, Cure)
  - enemy status init
  - ATKP level variants
- Removed: estimated gravity, the approach-assist hack, the `--clamp` and `--power-scale`
  switches, and the score-based selection.
- Verified on the install:
  - the jump peaks at 185 on frame 33
  - whiffing alternates 151/153
  - connecting gives 151→153→155
- Open: jump hold, stick-tilt mapping, landing, cancel points, auto-target, timer units.

### 2026-10-08: skeleton, animation and a mannequin
- Aerial Dodge is the jump button in mid-air (KH2), then Glide; it was on the action button.
- New readers:
  - MDLX skeletons
  - full interpolated motions (initial pose, F-curves with pre/post behaviour, IK helpers,
    joint table, constraints, activations, limiters, expressions, external effectors)
  - `00objentry.bin`
  - `03system.bin` → `sklt` (weapon bones)
- New crate `kh2-anim`, implemented from plain-language notes on the exe's motion evaluator:
  - key times are 60 Hz
  - the unscaled/scaled matrix pair
  - constraints and limiters
  - one- and two-bone analytic IK
  - the expression language
- Root motion is now sampled at 60 Hz key time. Lunges were half length before: A300 now
  travels 150.
- Playground: Sora is a capsule mannequin on his real bones, playing his real motions, with
  the Keyblade attached to bone 178. Hits use the real bone-attached attack spheres.
  `--data-dir local/re` runs from extracted files (research only).
- Verified locally:
  - every Sora motion poses without NaNs
  - idle stands at y = 0
  - screenshots of idle, run, attack, jump, roll and glide look right
- Open: per-move blend times, foot ground adaptation, head look-at, the Shadow's own
  skeleton.

### 2026-10-08: playtest fixes
- Stick left/right was mirrored (screen-right is −X when looking along +Z).
- Read from the exe:
  - **Variable jump height:** an early release swaps the rest of the rise for a 5.1-unit
    hop, after 6 frames and before apex − 5.
  - **Quick Run** lasts only while the button is held, and is ground-only.
  - **Dodge Roll's** frame-10 event chains into Quick Run while the button is held.
- Air combos: whiffs now advance the count, per the user's knowledge of the game (the exe's
  rule for this isn't found yet; ground stays hit-only).
- Rig:
  - **End-of-action zoom fixed:** the last frame was posed as a free loop without the root
    offset, and blending then smeared that jump.
  - Bones are now kept in object space.
  - The Keyblade's blade/keychain orientation is fixed.
  - New simplified mannequin.

### 2026-10-09: Phase 2 (skeleton-accurate hitboxes)
- **Hit detection, from the exe:**
  - Attack windows collect the attack- and guard-type shapes of their collision group.
    Defenders use their hit-type shapes.
  - The overlap test: sphere, column, ellipsoid; cubes never hit.
  - The 1.5 × radius sweep between frames.
  - Implemented engine-agnostically as `combat_core::{Shape, AttackVolume, first_overlap}`,
    with unit tests.
- **Data:**
  - `kh2_data::sora::BoneShape` keeps every MDLX collision entry: type, kind, bone or root,
    offset, lift, radius, height.
  - Guard windows keep their group (`WindowKind::Guard { attack, group, weapon }`).
    `Output::guard_boxes` lists them.
- **Blending, from the exe:**
  - blend lengths of 8 (default and locomotion), 16 (glide and the fall helper), PTYA
    `blend_time` for attacks (0) and 0 for queued follow-ups
  - the clock starts at 2
  - walk↔run phase sync
- **Playground:**
  - hits use the game's test, with the sweep
  - F1 attack/guard, F2 hit, F3 skeleton lines, F4 other collision types
  - `--show-hurt`, `--show-skeleton` and `--show-other` for screenshots
- **Open:**
  - clash table
  - wall-hit ray
  - the motion freeze during a blend
  - group-enable bits from the collision header
  - enemy collision (Phase 3)

### 2026-10-09: playtest fixes, ledge grab, wall hits, Phase 3
- **Landing (exe):** landing hands over to the idle action. The stick takes over at once, and
  with a neutral stick Sora stops dead instead of sliding.
- **Arena:** a box top crossed during a fast fall now counts as ground, and the support and
  push-out radii match. This fixes slipping off box tops.
- **Ledge grab (exe):** the search box, timing and placement, using `hang_*` from prty/sstm
  and the type-4 radius. Motion 7 hangs; motion 8 climbs.
- **Wall hits (exe):** the BG-hit ATKP flag, the ray from the previous centre, the
  floor-check ray, and the recoil (motion 41/43, 50 push or hop). The swing counts as
  connected.
- **Reactions and clashes (exe):** the shared reaction routine (groups, motions, hit-back
  distance, launch physics), the 7×7 clash table with angle checks, and the party and enemy
  clash reactions.
- **Enemies:**
  - `kh2_data::enemy` loads the Shadow (M_EX010) from the install
  - `character_core::npc` runs it
  - the playground's Shadows attack on our timer, hit Sora and get guarded
- **Open:** enemy scripts, weight, revenge, Sora's damage-lock length.

### 2026-10-09: Phase 4 (HUD, menus, abilities, magic)
- **Playground changes:**
  - one Shadow by default (`--enemies N`)
  - the ledge hang waits for a fresh push or jump before climbing (our change)
  - Aerial Recovery (jump during a launch)
- **Enemy weight (exe):** the body push is split by objentry weight.
- **03system item/cmd tables and msg text:**
  - the command menu (Attack, Magic, Items, Drive)
  - the ability menu with real names and AP and the level's AP cap
  - HP/MP gauges
- **Correction (exe):** the ATKP row "level" byte is the defender's consecutive-hit count
  from the same attack group, not the attacker's level. It is now implemented with the
  game's per-object hit record (`combat_core::HitRecord`: hit-once bits, group/count, a
  30-frame group timer for the player, 4 re-hit interval slots). Sora's and the Shadows'
  swings use it too.
- **New crate `kh2-bdx`:** the BDX script machine, written from the interpreter. The trap
  names come from OpenKH's list, whose 828 argument counts match the executable.
- **New crate `kh2-magic`:**
  - spell casting (trigger 20 with caster, resources, sub and the `magi` record; trigger 21
    at the cast motion's magic-cast event)
  - the 59 traps the six spells use
  - spell attacks (the game's magic attack shape and sweep, duplicates sharing ids)
  - effects (PAX elements by id, bone codes, lifetimes from the DPD emitter headers)
  - a y-down/y-up flip at the boundary
- **Reaction 5 (exe):** Magnet's orbit pull.
- **Verified:**
  - every spell file at every level runs to the end headlessly (`kh2-magic` test with
    extracted files)
  - in the playground: Firaga hits 5 times (alternating 8/10-frame re-hits, a 175% final);
    Blizzaga's shard; Thundaga's bolt; Curaga heals; Magnega lifts the Shadow into an orbit;
    Reflega stops a swipe and counters with 574 ×5 and a 667 burst
- **Open:**
  - the MP Charge rate
  - the target search without lock-on
  - Drive Form variants
  - enemy scripts (the VM is ready)

### 2026-10-09: Phase 4 finished (map collision, camera, Drive Forms, reaction commands)
- **New crate `map-collision` (exe):** the game's background solver.
  - one sphere (r 90, centre 115) plus a lower sphere for walls
  - sub-stepped push-out: faces, then edges
  - anti-tunnelling segment test
  - the floor ray with a 24-unit step-down
  - the 49% ceiling rule with a 16-frame air-command lock
  - Step-up 25 and the 38.5° slope limit come from the sphere's geometry.
  - The arena is now polygons: stairs, ramps, a floating slab.
- **New crate `kh2-camera` (exe):**
  - the field camera: distance/height curve, swing-behind, spring smoothing, wall pull-in
  - the lock-on framing
  - target switching
- **Drive Forms (exe + data):**
  - each form's object from objentry/pref/PTYA/wmst, with two weapons where the data has them
  - `character_core::drive`: the gauges, costs, Anti roll, levels and growth
  - Sora's Drive motion and invulnerability, the arrival motion, revert, magic subs
  - Wisdom's shots from its model's BDX script (`Magic::object_effect`, trap
    `obj_effect_start`)
- **Reaction commands (exe + data):**
  - RC areas from type-5 collision with group switching (motion trigger 4)
  - priority/score selection, the low-HP Drive offer
  - capture motions read from nested motion sets
  - the Soldier's Cyclone, as its script runs it
- **Correction:** the "Shadow" was a Soldier (M_EX010). The real Shadow is M_EX020.
- **Open:**
  - enemy scripts
  - other enemies' RCs
  - items, form keyblade stats
  - the MP Charge rate

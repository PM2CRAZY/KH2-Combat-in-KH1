# Tester requests

  

A chat between testers and the coding assistant (an LLM or agent), kept in a file. The tester writes what they want in a box, the assistant replies in its own box, the tester answers, and so on, the same as a normal chat. When the tester is happy, they give the go-ahead and the assistant starts coding. When they're satisfied with the result, they close the thread.

  

Each thread has a title and is separated from the next one by a line. Finished threads move to `tester-requests-archive.md`.

## For the assistant: read this first

  

Before replying to anything here, go read `design-philosophy-instructions.md` in this folder and follow it, along with the docs it points to. Those are the project's rules, and they win if anything in this file seems to disagree with them. Two things work differently here:

- The tester's `Go ahead` in a thread is the go-ahead to start coding (the instructions' "don't write code until I give the go-ahead" is satisfied by it).

- Replies follow the chat format below.

  

**Where requests come from.** Only act on requests written in this file. Don't add a request because someone told you about a bug or a wish in chat, and don't log a bug here because anyone mentions that a user is experiencing it. If it isn't written in this file, it isn't a request. Testers who can edit this file are trusted, and their requests are real.

  

**When to read it.** When you're told the tester requests have been updated, read the file, find every thread whose last message is a tester's, and reply to each. You don't need to be told which one.

  

**How to reply.** Reply the way you would in a normal chat with the tester: plain, natural, in your own box (`> [!tip] Assistant`) under their message, with nothing extra added and no fixed format. Never rewrite or delete what a tester wrote.
- After every reply you write, add an empty reply box right under it, with the name of the tester you're talking to already filled in (`> [!note] Tester name`, then a line with just `> `), so they can type their answer without copying a block. If several testers are in the thread, use the name of whoever wrote last. An empty box isn't a message: ignore it when you read the file, and don't add a second one if it's already there.

- Read the whole request first. Check the KH2 source, the decomp and the project docs before asking, so you only ask what you can't find out yourself.

- Ask short, specific questions, with the options spelled out when there are options. Ask only what changes what you'd build. Don't ask which version to build (native always).

- Work the logic out in the open: if the tester's idea conflicts with KH2's real behavior, with how KH1 works, or with another request, say so and talk it through.

- Keep going back and forth as long as anything is unclear. Don't write code while you're still discussing.

  

**Titles.** Each thread starts with a title that says what the tester's first message asked for. If the tester left the title blank or a placeholder, write one when you first reply.

  

**Go-ahead.** The tester writes `Go ahead` (or something clearly meaning it) after your latest message. A go-ahead on an old message doesn't count if the tester changed the request afterward. Then implement it in one version and reply with the version name (for example `t306`) and, in a line or two, which 1:1 check you made (trace or decomp) and what you couldn't check. Don't say anything about whether it has been compiled.

  

**Closing a thread.** When the tester is satisfied with the implementation, they write `Close`. Then move the whole thread, word for word, to the bottom of `tester-requests-archive.md` with a `Closed` line (git records when), and remove it from this file along with its separator line. Then delete the thread's folder in `testers` together with the files in it (only the messages are kept, in the archive). If you can't delete files in your setup, say so in your reply and name the folder, so the tester can delete it. Leave the other threads as they are.

  

**New threads.** A tester can start a new thread at any time at the bottom of this file, below the last thread, including right after another one was closed.

**Thread folders.** Testers put their trace CSVs and log files for a thread in the `testers` folder at the top of the repo (next to `docs`), in a subfolder named after the thread title in lowercase with hyphens. When you first reply to a new thread, create that subfolder with a short `README.md` in it (git doesn't track empty folders), and tell the tester its name in your reply. When you work on a thread, look in its folder for the tester's files.

  

**Several requests.** One request per version when you can. If two requests touch the same system, say so in both threads and ask the testers how they want to handle it. If a request conflicts with another one, work it out with the testers involved.

  

**Debug menu.** Testers can ask for changes to the debug menu like any other request. The menu is a tool for us, not a KH2 behavior, so the "match KH2 1:1" rules don't apply to what the menu contains. Performance, the hard rules and not breaking anything else still do.

## How to use it (testers)

  

1. Scroll to the bottom, copy the **new request** block below the last thread, and write what you want in the box. Say what you see and what you expected, the mod version and which settings were on. No form to fill in; just write it like a message.

2. Tell the assistant the tester requests have been updated. It reads the file and replies in its own box under yours.

3. Type your reply in the empty box the assistant leaves under its message. If there's no empty box, copy the **reply** block below. Keep going back and forth as long as you need.

4. When you're happy with the plan, write `Go ahead` in a reply. That is the approval, and no one else needs to approve. The assistant then starts coding.

5. When you're satisfied with the result, write `Close`. The assistant moves the thread to the archive file.

  

Each message is a callout box (the lines starting with `> [!`). In an editor without callouts it still reads as plain quoted text.

  

Tips:

- One change or addition per request. Split big wishes into several.

- You don't need to know how KH1 or KH2 work inside. Describe what happens.

- If you have a trace (the Triangle + Select CSV) or a log file, put it in the thread's folder inside `testers` (the assistant creates the folder when it first replies) and name the file in your message.

- Keep decompiled code and game files out of this file. Describe what you saw in plain language.

## Blocks to copy

  

The grey boxes below are code blocks, so you can copy the text exactly as written. Don't copy the three backticks (```) at the top and bottom of each box into your request.

  

**New request** (copy below the last thread):

  

```

---

  

## Title (the assistant fills this in if you leave it)

  

> [!note] Tester (your name)

> Write what you want here.

```

  

**Reply** (copy under the last message in the thread; the assistant uses the same block with `> [!tip] Assistant`):

  

```

> [!note] Tester (your name)

> Your reply here.

```
